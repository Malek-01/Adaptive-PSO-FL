# Adaptive-PSO-FL

The study presents an adaptive variant of particle swarm optimization that leverages fitness landscape analysis, specifically focusing on ruggedness. To assess its performance, the provided code has been  tested across nine global optimization benchmark functions. The code is designed with a user-friendly graphical interface, allowing users to select both the objective function of interest and the specific variant of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm.

Furthermore, this method has been examined in the context of feature selection problems. If you're interested in exploring the code and its applications, you can access it via the following link:
