# Adaptive-PSO-FL

The study presents an adaptive variant of particle swarm optimization that leverages fitness landscape analysis, specifically focusing on ruggedness. To assess its performance, the provided code has been  tested across nine global optimization benchmark functions. The code is designed with a user-friendly graphical interface, allowing users to select both the objective function of interest and the specific variant of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm.

The algorithms can be run by executing the file 'main.py'. Then, a graphical interface will open, allowing the algorithms to be tested on the 10 functions.

In the GitHub code, the file 'Pyswarms_gbest.py' and the 'GlobalBestPSO' function correspond to the native PSO. 'Pyswarms_entropy_gbest.py' and 'GlobalBestPSO_entropy' correspond to the adaptive PSO strategy using a deterministic method. 'Pyswarms_XY_gbest.py' and 'GlobalBestPSO_XY' correspond to the adaptive strategy using machine learning.

Furthermore, this method has been examined in the context of feature selection problems. If you're interested in exploring the code and its applications, you can access it via the following link:
